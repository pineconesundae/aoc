# Advent of Code

To run the code in this project, first get your OAuth session key from the browser when logged into adventofcode.com.  Then, make a copy of the session.js.example file in the util sub-directory, rename it to session.js, and paste the session key into the designated spot.  This filename is specified in the .gitignore file so that it won't be shared.

Once you have the session key in place, execute any day by using the following example command:

```bash
node 2020/01
```

Replace the `01` there with whatever day you want to execute.  That's it!
